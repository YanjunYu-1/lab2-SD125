There are various names and descriptions given to the "basic principles" of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 

Microsoft defines the basic principles of OOP as:

Abstraction
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Write at least one paragraph (3-5 sentences) in entirely your own words describing these principles, and what they mean to you. 

Provide an example of either how you have made use of one of these principles, or a hypothetical example of why you would want to use each. Include a simple method relating to the following scenario, either pseudo-coded or in C#, demonstrating this principle.

The Scenario
You have been hired to create a relational database and front end for a local bank.

Each Customer of this bank can have numerous accounts, of either the same or different types.

Different types of accounts can include special types of properties that others do not have (for example, a Checking account may have an overdraw fee, but a TFSA account may not) but all accounts at the very least track a balance for each customer. 

Much of this frontend would be customer-facing, but it system would also need Managers and Administrators to handle settings, accounts, and so on.
